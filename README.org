#+TITLE: AAGL on Guix
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

*** This channel includes packages that run proprietary software.
*** This is not part of GNU Guix.

* Overview

- Runs [[https://github.com/an-anime-team/][an-anime-team]] launchers on Guix inside an FHS container.
- Reuses the same mechanism as ~steam~ from [[https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix][nonguix]].
- The container isolates runtime and gives the launcher a sandboxed HOME.
- Path mapping inside the container:
  - =/home/<user>/= > =/home/<user>/.local/share/guix-sandbox-home/=

Note: this is a proof of concept and not yet complete.

* Add This Channel

Add the channel to your ~channels.scm~ and pull:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(channel
 (name 'aagl)
 (url "https://codeberg.org/ch4og/aagl-guix.git")
 (branch "main")
 (introduction
    (make-channel-introduction
     "1055d880e124d69a2aef85cac98a813d442a55fa"
     (openpgp-fingerprint
        "7C9E 7EBA 828C 58DF DACE  5BED 4DCC 7AB7 FC75 319B"))))
#+END_SRC

* Usage

** Configure the hosts service

*For Guix System users:* Add ~aagl-hosts-service-type~ to your system configuration
to block telemetry servers. This is required for the launchers to work properly.

*For other distributions:* The launchers will attempt to configure hosts blocking
automatically. If this fails, follow the official documentation for your specific
launcher on blocking telemetry.

Guix System configuration example:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(use-modules (aagl services hosts))

(operating-system
  ;; ...
  (services
   (cons* (service aagl-hosts-service-type)
          ;; ...
          %desktop-services)))
#+END_SRC

** Using the packages

Load the module defining the packages you want, then add them to a manifest or your configuration.

- Module: ~(aagl packages honkers-railway)~ provides:
    - ~honkers-railway-launcher~
    - ~honkers-railway-launcher-nvidia~

Example manifest snippet:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(use-modules (aagl packages honkers-railway))

(packages->manifest (list honkers-railway-launcher))
#+END_SRC

* Important Notes

- 32-bit support is not available.
- Upstream binaries are currently used, source builds may be added later.
- For NVIDIA setups some DXVK versions fail for now. I personally use DXVK 2.6.
